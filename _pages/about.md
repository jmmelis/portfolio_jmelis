Currently, I'm a PhD candidate in bioengineering at the Dickinson lab at Caltech (estimated graduation date October 2022). The research question of my PhD is how a fly controls flight with just 24 muscles? Insect flight is notoriously difficult to model; exotic aerodynamic mechanisms such as the leading-edge vortex and rotational forces are crucial for lift generation, Coriolis and centrifugal forces on the wings affect stability and finally the fly's wing hinge is so complex that even synchrotron tomography could not resolve it's mechanics. 

To overcome these difficulties I have developed several hardware and software tools from scratch. A dynamically-scaled robotic wing (RoboFly) that is submerged in a tank of mineral oil can replay any type of wing motion and simultaneously measure the aerodynamic forces.
